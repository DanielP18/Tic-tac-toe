# Tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe against the computer that uses the minimax algorithm, making the computer unbeatable. Written in C++

The "WinterProject.cpp" file is my original attempt at creating tic-tac-toe, that one is only player vs player. I then learned more about the minimax algorithm and implemented it to create tic-tac-toe vs an unbeatable computer. The "Minimax.cpp" is the most recent tic-tac-toe game and i am leaving the old winterproject.cpp just to see my progress overtime.
